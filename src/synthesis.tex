\texttt{UGens>Buffer}

\bigskip

This  \textit{Pseudo-UGen} convert quadraphonic recording MS/XY (using the re- corder Zoom H2N for instance, see page \pageref{mp:msxy} for details) to a four channels equal power panner, with outputs in order LeftFront, RightFront, LeftBack, RightBack.

Note the method \texttt{convertPan4toArray}, which distributes amplitudes in the quadraphonic space according to the panoramic positions (see description on page \pageref{pandist}).

The idea is to apply some `macro' formal objects to a sonic object as it is. These macro-forms are described in the previous chapters respectively as \nameref{imp2} on page \pageref{imp2} and \nameref{imp3} on page \pageref{imp3}.

Note the array of ratios must be non-zero positive numbers.

The respective delays according to the array of ratios are computed as follow:
 
\[
\bigcup_{r \in \mathbf{rat}} \mathbf{del} \left( \frac{1}{min(\mathbf{rat})} - \frac{1}{r} \right)
\]

\bigskip
For a given positive integer $n$, the Collatz algorithm generate a finite series which is interpreted as an amplitude envelop on the time/x-axis. The envelope is normalised on the amplitude/y-axis by divided the envelope by $n$ as frequency or as a maximal value of the profile. 

\bigskip

Each profile as an envelope is multiplied by its respective \textit{Ugen} taking into account the value $n$ as the frequency argument. This is done recursively through a given array of frequencies as integers.
