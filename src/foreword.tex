\section*{About this edition}
\label{ate}

\bigskip
This journal is a witness to a decade of work on music with a conceptual approach.
This is far from perfect, and probably, on some points, outdated, even obsolete, but I have the weakness to believe this is worth reading and sharing.

The first part of this book regroups articles as chapters fitting my research interest in music analysis and synthesis in terms of algorithms. 
\smallskip

Most of my works are interconnected in this writing as a development, a continuation, or an experiment. A distinct work also connected to this writing  
 is the \textsl{Neuromuse3} project (N3), which aims to develop algorithms in terms of neuroscience and cognition in a `musical' context. The documentation is available online:

Common Lisp libraries required and designed for this work:

\smallskip

\noindent $\rightarrow$ \textsl{cl-gsa} notably mentioned in the chapters \textsl{\nameref{m2t}} and \textsl{\nameref{mds}}.

\href{https://github.com/yannics/cl-gsa}{\texttt{\small https://github.com/yannics/cl-gsa}}

\smallskip

\noindent $\rightarrow$ \textsl{cl-cycle} mentioned in the chapters \textsl{\nameref{imp1}} and  \textsl{\nameref{imp2}}.

%\bigskip
\newpage
The second and the third parts refer to the \textit{praxis} as concepts and as experiments \textit{in situ}. The SuperCollider \texttt{gsa.quark} is required.

\section*{Third-party softwares}
\label{tps}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\nameref{tps}}

Some third-party softwares are required for some of these works. 

\subsection*{Praat}

Praat is a free software for the analysis of speech in phonetics. It was designed, and continues to be developed, by Paul Boersma and David Weenink of the University of Amsterdam. 

\href{http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat}{\texttt{\small http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat}}

\bigskip

Praat is used for the analysis of the sound file. Praat can be scripted and it can be called in a Bash script. The Praat manual displays all the needed information concerning the algorithms and the parameters used in Praat.

\subsection*{SBCL}

SBCL means Steel Bank Common Lisp. It is a free software and a mostly-conforming implementation of the ANSI Common Lisp standard.

\href{http://www.sbcl.org}{\texttt{\small http://www.sbcl.org}}

\bigskip

Common Lisp is a very efficient and flexible programming language specifically and historically dedicated to Artificial Intelligence.
SBCL can be called in a Bash script.

\subsection*{Morphologie}

Morphologie is an OpenMusic and PWGL library implemented in Common Lisp. Morphologie is a set of functions of analysis, recognition, classification and reconstitution of symbolic and digital sequences, developed by Jacopo Baboni-Schilingi and Fr\'ed\'eric Voisin at the IRCAM in 1997.

%\href{http://www.fredvoisin.com/spip.php?article28}{\texttt{\small http://www.fredvoisin.com/spip.php?article28}}

\bigskip

In this work, I adapted some functions for a 'pure' Common Lisp use.

\subsection*{Midi}

This is a Common Lisp library for parsing MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) file format files and representing MIDI events.

\href{http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/isms/lisp/midi}{\texttt{\small http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/isms/lisp/midi}}

\bigskip

In the chapter \textsl{\nameref{mds}}, section \textsl{\nameref{score}}, the midi package is required as a dependency of \textsl{cl-gsa}.

\subsection*{FluidSynth}

FluidSynth is a free software synthesizer and can be used as a command line shell.

\href{http://www.fluidsynth.org}{\texttt{\small http://www.fluidsynth.org}}

\bigskip

With the package \texttt{fluid-soundfont-gm}, \texttt{FluidSynth} allows converting midi file to a sound file -- see chapter \textsl{\nameref{mds}}, section \textsl{\nameref{cmftmds}}.

\subsection*{SuperCollider}

SuperCollider is a programming language for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.

\href{http://supercollider.github.io}{\texttt{\small http://supercollider.github.io}}

\bigskip

\noindent And also,

\subsection*{SoX}

SoX (Sound eXchange) is a cross-platform command line utility that allows manipulating audio files.

\href{http://sox.sourceforge.net}{\texttt{\small http://sox.sourceforge.net}}

\bigskip

The associated command line SoXI (Sound eXchange Information) allows the displaying of sound file metadata.

\subsection*{Gnuplot}

Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing utility as an interactive plotting program.

\href{http://www.gnuplot.info}{\texttt{\small http://www.gnuplot.info}}

\subsection*{Graphviz}

Graphviz is open source graph visualization software using graph layout programs, such as Neato -- see note \fullref{neato}.
